### comment
Ash Pallicial is CEO & Founder of Getprofiles.
However, he did not have the qualifications and dignity as CEO.
He is a very fraudulent scam.
Please refer to this if someone is working with him.
He likes to make impossible contracts and he wants to change even those contracts easily.
Once his project is completed he will not pay anything and he will demands impossible something.
In short, he is a very low quality human with an intelligence that is closer to the animal's brain than the human brain.
It would not be an exaggeration to say he is animals.
